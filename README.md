*Bay Window* is a window installation that projects Mozilla's ideals of data transparency and Internet health. It features a custom, three-dimensional interface with geometrically-designed typography and shaders to complement the architecture of the window.

This code is an early prototype that converts moving images and live video to the triangular grid.
